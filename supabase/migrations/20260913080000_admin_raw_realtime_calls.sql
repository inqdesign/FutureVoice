-- The realtime call path leaves a record — and the console reads it.
--
-- Launch week's calls all ran through the gateway (a Worker + Durable
-- Object), whose reply and voice go straight to their providers: nothing
-- about a call reached `usage_ledger` except the meter's ticks, and a call
-- that died mid-turn reached NOTHING. On 2026-09-12 that produced a console
-- showing zero errors on a day when 25 of 42 sessions ended before the
-- learner finished a sentence, and the two people who cancelled were found
-- by reading `user_subscriptions` by hand.
--
-- The client now writes three events (`talk_rt_session` at every hang-up,
-- `talk_rt_failed`, `talk_rt_warning`), and this adds the two keys that let
-- the page draw them:
--
--   rt_sessions   one row per finished call: why it ended, turns, seconds,
--                 the p50 commit→voice latency, warnings survived
--   rt_reasons    the same, rolled up by reason for the last 7 days
--
-- The per-user `recent_events` list drops `talk_rt_session` (it is not an
-- error and would be the loudest row on the page) but KEEPS the failures
-- and warnings, which belong beside a person's name.
